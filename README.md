# üìä Task 4: SQL for E-commerce Data Analysis (Elevate Labs Internship)

## üéØ Objective
The primary goal of this task was to demonstrate proficiency in using advanced SQL concepts (Subqueries, Views, Aggregate Functions) to extract meaningful business insights from a single e-commerce transactions table.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key SQL Techniques Used
This task successfully utilized all required advanced techniques:

* **Subqueries:** Used to calculate the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).
* **Views:** Created a permanent `Store_Performance_Summary_V` view for simplified recurring analysis.
* **Indexing:** Created an index on `customer_key` to optimize query performance for customer-level metrics.
* **Aggregate Functions:** Used `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()` to calculate core metrics like Total Revenue and ATV.
* **Filtering:** Applied both `WHERE` (on individual rows) and `HAVING` (on grouped data) for detailed sales analysis.
* **Grouping:** Used `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to rank products and stores.

## üìà Key Business Insights (Findings)

Based on the analysis of the `sales_transactions` data, the following key metrics were observed:

| Metric | Result | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue** | 3541.50 | (See Screenshot 2) The overall sales figure provides a baseline for performance tracking. |
| **ARPU** | 90.80 | (See Screenshot 3) The average revenue generated by a single customer. |
| **Top Performing Item** | ID00155 (Revenue: 306.00) | This item is the highest revenue driver and should be promoted. |
| **Top Performing Store** | S0079 (Revenue: 270.00) | Store S0079 is the current revenue leader (See Screenshot 6). |
